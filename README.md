# gpt

A way to evaluate a gpt model for how well it can improve code.   It will iterate and make changes, and execute based on observations it has made about previous runs.

It may be necessary to use a unique dataset other than the breast cancer for this problem in order to avoid solving it via training data, but I use it here as an example.
